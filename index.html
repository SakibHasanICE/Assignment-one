          People often get confused about where to give Zakat and how much to
          offer.<br />
          It requires Muslims to provide 2.5% of their qualifying wealth each

            Tackling hunger on the frontline of emergencies is critical, but we
            also need long-lasting solutions. That's why we work with countries
            around the world to help vulnerable people everywhere get the food
            they need to survive and thrive.

            We’re so excited to be working with the community of Motuse on our
            first community based solar powered clean water project! This system
            will serve all 623 people in the community, and will aim to
            accomplish two goals.

            Today, 690 million people around the world will go to bed on an
            empty stomach. But your gift means that one less child will be at
            risk of starvation tonight.
